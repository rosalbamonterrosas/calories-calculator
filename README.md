Calories Calculator

This program is a calculator of calories burned while casual walking. 

First, the user is prompted to enter their weight, height, and the total number of steps that they have walked. The program contains user input validation to ensure that the user has entered a correct value. If the user entered an incorrect value, the user is notified and is given the ability to try again until they enter a correct value. 

The values that the user enters is stored and used to conduct calculations. The following results are calulated:
Calories burned per mile
The user's stride length in inches
The number of steps per mile
Calories burned per step
Total calories burned

Each ouput is stored in their own array. Each element in the array represents a single attempt. 

The total calories burned output is categorized into one of three categories: low, medium, or high. 

The user is allowed ten attempts, and the outputs are printed out to the user after each attempt. Also, the user is notified of how many attempts they have remaining and are given the option to quit the program. If the user quits the program, the outputs of all of their attempts are printed out to the user.
